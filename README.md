A simple python program for syncing file structures between a remote FTP server and the host running the program.

To get started create a copy of Base.Sample.py named: Base.py.  The just add the settings for your FTP server
and local file system.  Once you've set values for all the properties in the Base class's constructor you can run
DownloadProcessor.py or schedule it with your operating system to run on a timer.
